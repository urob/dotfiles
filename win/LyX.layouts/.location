%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\LyX 2.3\Resources\layouts

may also work in:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\LyX2.3\layouts
which contains user layouts. Question is whether beamer.layout there takes precedence
over default layout in the resources folder above. If this is case, can just move this
folder into win/LyX/layouts in this repo
